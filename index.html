                            I'm also pursuing a French minor. I'll be graduating in May 2025, and I'm looking forward to everything I'll learn in this 
                            web design class.

                            I spend most of my time watching YouTube videos or Netflix, playing video games, or napping to be quite honest. 
                            I do have a lot of hobbies I enjoy though, like crocheting, playing piano, bike riding, and playing tennis. I also 
                            would like to get more into art and video game design, as well as voice acting and animation.
