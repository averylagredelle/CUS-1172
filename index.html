                Hello! My name is Avery Lagredelle, and this is my profile. I'm a sophomore at St. John's majoring in computer science.
                I'm also pursuing a French minor. I'll be graduating in May 2025, and I'm looking forward to everything I'll learn in this 
                web design class.

            <h2> Programming Skills </h2>
            <p>
                I've been interested in programming since high school, but I only started learning to program when I came to college, giving me 
                only about 2 years of experience so far. At present, these are the languages I'm familar with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Java (Beginner)</li>
                <li>C# (Beginner)</li>
                <li>HTML(beginner)</li>

            <h2> General Interests </h2>
            <p>
                I spend most of my time watching YouTube videos or Netflix, playing video games, or napping to be quite honest. 
                I do have a lot of hobbies I enjoy though, like crocheting, playing piano, bike riding, and playing tennis. I also 
                would like to get more into art and video game design, as well as voice acting and animation.
